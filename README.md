# Cisco Firewall Labs

## Objective
This section showcases hands-on experience in configuring and managing Cisco firewalls. Tasks include access control, NAT configuration, traffic monitoring, and troubleshooting for secure and efficient network management.

## Skills Learned
- Configuring Access Control Lists (ACLs).
- Setting up NAT for internal and external traffic management.
- Monitoring and managing network interfaces.
- Troubleshooting connectivity and configuration issues.
- Understanding Cisco ASDM and CLI tools for firewall management.

## Tools Used
- Cisco ASDM (Adaptive Security Device Manager)
- Cisco CLI
- Telnet and SSH for device access
- Syslog Servers
- Wireshark

## Tasks
Below are the key tasks performed:

- Configured inbound and outbound access control lists (ACLs) for traffic regulation.
- Applied ACLs to specific interfaces to manage access.

### 4. NAT Configuration
- Configured static and dynamic NAT to translate internal IPs to external addresses.
- Implemented Port Address Translation (PAT) for multiple hosts sharing a single IP.

### 5. Traffic Monitoring and Logs
- Enabled logging to monitor real-time traffic and troubleshoot issues.
- Configured and analyzed syslog data for security events.

### 6. Connectivity Troubleshooting
- Diagnosed interface and routing issues using CLI commands.
- Resolved NAT and ACL misconfigurations impacting network connectivity.
